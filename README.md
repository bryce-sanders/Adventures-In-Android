# Overview

This project marks my very first venture into mobile app development. In completing this project, I have the opportunity to learn a very marketable and in-demand skill.

The app I am creating a simple To-Do List application for android. Users will be able to add items to a list, check them off as they are completed, and remove all checked off items when they are done.

I am undertaking this project to help me to further my academic progress.
